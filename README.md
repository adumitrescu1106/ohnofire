  We couldn't send all the files in the project but we managed only to send the dart files that contain the code , and the .yaml file
where we did some change (the project file was too big). "mainmenu.dart" should be built and run separately from the others because the fire map and the Menu/Profile Menu
are separated from the map implemenation.
